# coming-soon
Just a little project coded on half a day to put me under pressure to code something else better later.

I having fun with [typeit.js](https://github.com/alexmacarthur/typeit) and [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/).

## TODO
For motivated people, I recommend adding a little dysplay none on overlay's content when it's closed to avoid this overwriting text effect.
